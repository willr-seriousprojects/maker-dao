### Meeting notes 2019-05-31

Analysis: 
- relationship between eth and dai changed in dynamic
- supply of dai just been reducing
- age of debt has been reducing -> healthy. costs realised
- what is the right relationship between dai price and price movements? (discussion)
- eth has been taken out of collateralisation -> collateralisation ratio increasing -> impact on secondary lending -> more dai drawn out of Compound and other platforms. Note: DSR supposed to balance out the refinancing dynamic

Multi-collateral:
- collateral analysis required: collateral ratio, liquidity, debt ceiling..
- building out piece-by-piece of analysis
- framework
- SF will be different between assets
- DSR will be same between assets

Next steps:
- understanding of asset and its valuation
- evaluate the risks of asset -> build into risk premium of asset
- how fast CDPs are liquidated
