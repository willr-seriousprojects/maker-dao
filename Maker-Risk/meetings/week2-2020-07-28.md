# Points to cover

## WIP status:
- progress on:
    - data sourcing 
    - data cleaning 

- challenges: 
    * sourcing: 
        - multiple data sources (off-chain)
        - on-chain querying (DEX, liquidity pools)
    * cleaning/wrangling:
        - indexing data from multiple sources 
        - merging/combining time series 

Points to note:
- first collateral is harder!
- building a data source list (repository)
- scripting code to source data from same endpoints
    - time series
    - discrete vs continuous data e.g. token holding (discrete) -> holding concentration; asset price (continuous, series)

## Week plan:

- data wrangling: 2 days
- data analysis:
    - stats summaries 
    - correlation analysis 
    - hypothesis testing 
        - data sampling vs population
        - measures of mean/variance/std
        - level of significance 
        - p-value> stats significance 
- simulation data: 
    - monte carlo gbm

METRICS AND ANALYSIS

**Token**
- daily active addresses (santiment)
- daily new addresses (excl ico distro) (santiment)
- daily onchain transaction volume (santiment)

Token distribution, return, inflation 
- token supply amount
- circulating supply amount
- token burnt amount
- implied market cap
- returns 1m/3m/6m/12m
- inflation by period 

(cryptocompare, coinmarketcap, etherscan, manaboard)

- Token holding concentration (etherscan)

Tokens on exchange

CEX
- daily trading volume (usd) in centralised exchanges (cryptocompare)

SUMMARY OF RISKS

Categories:
- volume 
- prices
- volatility
- DEX trading

Token
- token info (supply, circulating, mktcap...)
- exchange balance
- ICO distribution/vesting
- token burn (time series, accumulated)

Auction slippage inputs

**Liquidation data**
- count of liquidations 
- amount of liquidations 

**Balancer pools data**
- weighted pools 
- LINK



Liquidation data 
- liquidation is the var where are trying to predict (classification problem 0 = not liquidated 1 = liquidated)
- there is no liquidation data for LINK 
- there is liquidation data for other assets > extrapolation 
- can we look into (linear?) relationship between asset price and liquidation. i.e. Does variation in price predict liquidation?  
- can we look into (linear?) relationship between asset volatility and liquidation. i.e. Does volatility (daily,hourly) predict liquidation?
- does liquidation generate a gain or a loss
- how much stability fee to offset gain or loss from liquidation


**Model explanation**

problems: 
- new collateral onboarding
- template for future risk management

deliverables: 
- quantitative framework for evaluating risk (vault risk)
- qualitative framework for fundamental collateral analysis

assumptions: 
- not a magic ball 
- requires community engagement

## maker risk at a glance

DAI token
- peg at 1s
- monetary risk 
- dai holders bear credit risk 

Vaults
- borrowers generate dai through vaults
- mkr holders bear credit risk of vaults
- mkr holders govern risk by setting risk param
- if liquidation, maker recover dai through collateral sale/mkd dilution

goals

dai token
- grow usage/sustainable
- peg: supply/demand
- monetary policy: dsr, sf, dc
- method: deterministic rate setting, general heuristics

vaults
- maximise value for mkr holders
- value f(x) liquidations, sf + risk associated
- balance equation (credit risk, insolvency...)
- quantify dc per collateral
- quantify mkr dilution + appropriate surplus buffer + buffer 
- collateral onboarding 

## Where is the risk 

vaults

## MakerDAO Risk Model

monetary policy vs collateral risk 
vaults pose a credit risk 

How to answer (approach)
- credit risk modelling 
- how often liquidations + at what collateral ratio
- calc gains/losses mkr as value recovered post liquidation
- probability of gains/losses over time period of simulation 
- distro to determine avg expected loss
- distro to determine 0.1% worst tail cases

> what to do with info once you have

asset price is primary independent variable

consider: collateralisation by eth price time series simulation
gains & losses from liquidation events 

process: 
asset price > collateralisation ratios > determine amt debt liquidated > depending on CR estimate gains or losses

approach: 
- monte carlo simulation
- asset prices by time steps
- avg of monte carlo > collect tail events 
- used in stress testing e.g. asset prices 

- distributions of losses over simulation results 
- get avg % losses for each simulation

## analyse probability distro losses

- relative likelihood of diff amt of losses 
- expected loss : mean of distro of losses
- VaR = loss threshold beyond which losses are unlikely (< 0,1%)

EL comes from expected loss from liquidations 
- VaR: euristic 
- under normal market condition... 
- 99.9% sure not loose more than some amount...

## Surplus buffer + mkr issuance 

- covers losses
