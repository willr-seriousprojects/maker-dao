    "- Velocity: Shows the average number of times that a single LINK token changes addresses daily. Higher token velocity means that a single token is used more often in daily transactions.\n",
    "- Age consumed: Tracks the movement of previously idle LINK tokens. The metric shows the amount of LINK changing addresses daily multiplied by the number of days since they last moved. Spikes indicate a significant amount of previously idle LINK tokens moving between addresses.\n",
